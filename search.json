    "text": "The transition model on rough walls is based on a combination of the four-equation transition model \\(\\gamma - \\tilde{Re}_\\theta\\) according to Langtry and Menter (Langtry and Menter 2009) with an additional equation for the amplification factor \\(A_r\\) according to Dassler et al. (Dassler, Kožulović, and Fiala 2010). In subsequent publications, this model has been presented in various variants and calibrations, e.g., Langel et al. (Langel et al. 2017a) or Kožulović et al. (Kožulovič et al. 2022).\nThe transition model according to Dassler et al. contains the following three equations: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial (\\rho \\gamma)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (\\rho u_j \\gamma)}{\\partial x_j} &= P_\\gamma - E_\\gamma + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left[ \\left( \\mu + \\frac{\\mu_t}{\\sigma_f} \\right) \\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial x_j} \\right],\n\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial (\\rho \\tilde{Re}_\\theta)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (\\rho u_j \\tilde{Re}_\\theta)}{\\partial x_j} &= P_\\theta + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left[ \\sigma_\\theta \\left( \\mu + \\mu_t \\right) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{Re}_\\theta}{\\partial x_j} \\right],\n\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial (\\rho A_r)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (\\rho u_j A_r)}{\\partial x_j} &= P_{A_r} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left[ \\sigma_{A_r} \\left( \\mu + \\mu_t\\right) \\frac{\\partial A_r}{\\partial x_j} \\right].\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nThe role of \\(\\sigma_f\\) and other \\(\\sigma\\) coefficients in the formulas is different! However, the value of \\(\\sigma_f\\) is 1, so it probably doesn’t matter.\n\n\nIn the original article (Dassler, Kožulović, and Fiala 2010), the source term in the equation for \\(A_r\\) is applied in the first layer of cells near the wall. This does not make sense from a mathematical point of view, and therefore this original model was not tested. In a later article (Dassler, Kožulović, and Fiala 2012), a version is presented where a boundary condition for \\(A_r\\) is prescribed at the wall and the source term is applied throughout the entire computational domain. In this model, the value is \\(\\sigma_{A_r} = 10\\) and at the wall, the following boundary condition for \\(A_r\\) is considered \\[\nA_{r,w} = 8 k_s^+, \\quad \\text{kde } k_s^+ = \\frac{u_\\tau k_s}{\\nu}.\n\\]\nThe original source term in the equation for \\(\\tilde{Re}_\\theta\\) \\[\nP_\\theta = c_{\\theta t}\\frac{\\rho}{T}\\left(Re_{\\theta} - \\tilde{Re}_\\theta \\right)\n(1 - F_{\\theta t})\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwas modified to the form \\[\nP_\\theta = c_{\\theta t}\\frac{\\rho}{T}\\left[\\left(Re_{\\theta} - \\tilde{Re}_\\theta \\right)\n(1 - F_{\\theta t}) - Arg_r\\right],\n\\] where \\(Arg_r\\) is a function dependent on \\(A_r\\), which shifts the transition onset towards lower values of \\(\\tilde{Re}_\\theta\\) depending on the wall roughness.\nHowever, the functional form of \\(Arg_r\\) is not published in the article. Therefore, this model was not further tested.\n\n\nThe model according to Langel et al. (Langel et al. 2017a) uses the same approach as Dassler et al., but with different calibration and provides a specific functional form for \\(Arg_r\\). In this model, the value is \\(\\sigma_{A_r} = 30\\) and the boundary condition at the wall is for the case of flat plate flow (see (Langel et al. 2017a, 109)) \\[\nA_{r,w} = \\frac{20000}{1 + e^{13.5 - k_s^+}}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nDependence of boundary condition \\(A_{r,w}\\) on dimensionless roughness \\(k_s^+\\) according to (Langel et al. 2017a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nThere is apparently an error in the notation of the boundary condition for \\(A_{r,w}\\) in the original article (Langel et al. 2017a), see comparison with the graph on page 103 in (Langel et al. 2017a). The above version corresponds to this graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nFor airfoil flow, a different correlation is used for the boundary condition. The value 13.5 in the exponent is replaced by approximately 27, see the graph on page 103 in (Langel et al. 2017a).\n\n\nThe source term in the equation for \\(\\tilde{Re}_\\theta\\) is modified as \\[\nP_\\theta = c_{\\theta t}\\frac{\\rho}{T}\\left[\\left(Re_{\\theta} - \\tilde{Re}_\\theta \\right)\n(1 - F_{\\theta t}) - b F_{A_r}\\right]\n\\] kde \\[\nF_{A_r} = \\begin{cases}\n4 A_r^{0.42} + 4 A_r \\left(\\frac{1}{F(\\lambda_\\theta)}\\right)(1 - F_{\\theta t}), & \\text{for } F(\\lambda_\\theta) \\le 1, \\\\\n4 A_r^{0.42} + 4 A_r \\left(\\frac{1}{F(\\lambda_\\theta)}\\right)^{0.6}(1 - F_{\\theta t}), & \\text{for } F(\\lambda_\\theta) &gt; 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe function \\(F(\\lambda_\\theta)\\) is defined as in the original model by Langtry and Menter Langtry and Menter (2009) as \\[\nF(\\lambda_\\theta) = \\begin{cases}\n1 + (12.986 \\lambda_\\theta + 123.66 \\lambda_\\theta^2 + 405.689 \\lambda_\\theta^3) e^{-\\left(Tu/1.5\\right)^{1.5}} , & \\text{for } \\lambda_\\theta \\le 0, \\\\\n1 + 0.275\\left(1 - e^{-35\\lambda_\\theta}\\right)e^{-\\left(Tu/0.5\\right)}, & \\text{for } \\lambda_\\theta &gt; 0,\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nDependence of function \\(F(λ_θ)\\) according to (Langel et al. 2017a) for different values of \\(Tu\\).\n\n\n\n\nThe damping factor \\(b\\) is given by the relation \\[\nb = 0.5\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{155}\\tilde{Re}_\\theta - \\frac{97\\pi}{155}\\right) + 0.5.\n\\] In this function, it is apparently appropriate to limit the value of \\(\\tilde{Re}_\\theta\\) to the interval \\([19.5, 174.5]\\), i.e., \\[\nb = 0.5\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{155}\\max(\\min(\\tilde{Re}_\\theta, 174.5), 19.5) - \\frac{97\\pi}{155}\\right) + 0.5.\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nDependence of damping factor \\(b\\) on the value of \\(Re_θ\\) according to (Langel et al. 2017a).\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, a modified boundary condition for \\(\\omega\\) at the wall is used according to (Langel et al. 2017a) based on the work of (Wilcox 1994): \\[\n\\omega_w = \\frac{u_\\tau^2 S_r}{\\nu},\n\\] kde \\[\nS_r = \\begin{cases}\n\\left(\\frac{50}{k_s^+}\\right)^2 & \\text{for } k_s^+ \\le 25, \\\\\n\\frac{100}{k_s^+} & \\text{for } k_s^+ &gt; 25.\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nCompared to the model according to (Langel et al. 2017a), a modification of the boundary condition for \\(\\omega\\) in the case of a smooth wall is used in the implementation \\[\n\\omega_w = \\begin{cases}\n10 \\frac{6\\nu}{\\beta_1 y_1^2} & \\text{for } k_s^+ \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{2500\\beta_1}{60}} y^+_1, \\\\\n\\frac{u_\\tau^2 S_r}{\\nu} & \\text{for } k_s^+ &gt; \\sqrt{\\frac{2500\\beta_1}{60}} y^+_1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nIn the newer edition of the book (Wilcox 2006), this boundary condition for a smooth wall is given in the form \\[\nS_r = \\begin{cases}\n\\left(\\frac{200}{k_s^+}\\right)^2 & \\text{for } k_s^+ \\le 5, \\\\\n\\frac{100}{k_s^+} + \\left[ \\left(\\frac{200}{k_s^+}\\right)^2 - \\frac{100}{k_s^+}\\right]\ne^{5-k_s^+}& \\text{for } k_s^+ &gt; 5.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nHowever, this form of boundary condition was not used in the calculations. Furthermore, (Wilcox 2006) presents a boundary condition for a rough wall for the low Reynolds version of the model. It differs from the above condition only in the coefficient of the second branch, where 60 is used instead of 100 (in both places).

The value of \\(\\sigma_{A_r}\\) in this model is set to \\(\\sigma_{A_r} = 10\\) and the boundary condition at the wall is \\[\nA_{r,w} = c_{r1} k_s^+,\n\\] where \\(c_{r1} = 8\\). The function \\(F_{A_r}\\) in the equation for \\(\\tilde{Re}_\\theta\\) is \\[\nF_{A_r} = \\begin{cases}\nc_{r2} Ar^3, & \\text{for } Ar &lt; C_{Ar}, \\\\\nc_{r3} (Ar - C_{Ar}) + c_{r2} C_{Ar}^3, & \\text{for } Ar \\ge C_{Ar},\n\\end{cases}\n\\] where \\(c_{r2} = 0.0005\\), \\(c_{r3} = 2\\) and \\(C_{Ar} = \\sqrt{c_{r3}/3c_{r2}}\\), see (Langel et al. 2017b) [p. 65]. The coefficient \\(b\\) in this version of the model is given by the relation (compare with Equation 2) \\[\nb = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{155}\\widetilde{Re}_\\theta - \\frac{97\\pi}{155}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2.\n\\tag{5}\\] As with the Langel2017 model, it is appropriate to limit the value of \\(\\tilde{Re}_\\theta\\) to the interval \\([19.5, 174.5]\\) in this relation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDependence of damping factor \\(b\\) on the value of \\(Re_θ\\) according to (Langel et al. 2017b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the most recent publication (Kožulovič et al. 2022), another version of the transition model on rough walls is presented with different calibration and a boundary condition for \\(A_r\\) at the wall.

In the original model according to (Dassler, Kožulović, and Fiala 2012), the damping function \\(b\\) is also mentioned in the text. However, its functional form is not given. Therefore, the function according to Equation 5 was used. Furthermore, for reasonable agreement with experiment, it was necessary to multiply \\(Arg_r\\) by a coefficient of 10, i.e., \\[\nP_\\theta = c_{\\theta t}\\frac{\\rho}{T}\\left[\\left(Re_{\\theta} - \\tilde{Re}_\\theta \\right)\n(1 - F_{\\theta t}) - 10 b \\cdot Arg_r\\right].\n\\tag{6}\\]\n\n\n\nThe models differ both in the values of \\(\\sigma_{A_r}\\) and the boundary condition for \\(A_r\\) at the wall, as well as in the modification of the source term in the equation for \\(\\tilde{Re}_\\theta\\).

Furthermore, for reasonable agreement with experiment, it was necessary to multiply \\(Arg_r\\) by a coefficient of 10, i.e., \\[\nP_\\theta = c_{\\theta t}\\frac{\\rho}{T}\\left[\\left(Re_{\\theta} - \\tilde{Re}_\\theta \\right)\n(1 - F_{\\theta t}) - 10 b \\cdot Arg_r\\right].\n\\tag{6}\\]",

It is based on the Boussinesq approximation but goes beyond the linear eddy-viscosity concept by providing an explicit algebraic formulation for the Reynolds stress tensor. This allows the model to capture anisotropic turbulence effects more accurately than traditional two-equation models.
