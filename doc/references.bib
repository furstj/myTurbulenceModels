                  kω model is especially designed for the requirements typical

                  model sensitivity to pressure gradients, and to the
                  calibration of the model coefficients for appropriate flow
                  phenomena. The model development is based on both analytical
                  studies and numerical experimenting. The developed model is

  abstract =	 {Depending on the manufacturing process and the operating
                  conditions, airfoil surface may show many different
                  roughness characteristics, together with a significant
                  influence at the boundary layer development. In this paper,
                  only the influence at the laminar-turbulent transition is
                  considered and modeled by an extension of the γ-Re Θ
                  transition model of Langtry and Menter. Essentially, an
                  additional transport equation for a roughness amplification
                  scalar is used to modify the transition onset and
                  development , as already presented by Dassler et al. in
                  2012. In the meantime, the calibrated functional
                  relationship for Arg r has been released for the publication
                  for the first time in this paper. In addition, the model
                  performance will be demonstrated and discussed on test cases
                  with increasing complexity, including turbomachinery
                  cascades and rigs. As an input to the model, the equivalent
                  sand-grain roughness is required. In this way, the versatile
                  roughness characteristics of the investigated surface are
                  reduced to only one parameter. The model has been
                  implemented into the CFD software package TRACE of DLR
                  Institute of Propulsion Technology. Only steady flow test
                  cases have been investigated and validated. The transition
                  intermittency is coupled to the two-equation turbulence
                  model of Wilcox. In this model, the roughness influence at
                  the fully turbulent boundary layers is also captured by the
                  variation of the boundary condition for the specific
                  turbulence dissipation rate ω.},

                  free shear turbulent flows with system rotation and/or

   abstract = {Some new developments of explicit algebraic Reynolds stress turbulence models (EARSM) are presented. The new developments include a new near-wall treatment ensuring realizability for the individual stress components, a formulation for compressible flows, and a suggestion for a possible approximation of diffusion terms in the anisotropy transport equation. Recent developments in this area are assessed and collected into a model for both incompressible and compressible three-dimensional wall-bounded turbulent flows. This model represents a solution of the implicit ARSM equations, where the production to dissipation ratio is obtained as a solution to a nonlinear algebraic relation. Three-dimensionality is fully accounted for in the mean flow description of the stress anisotropy. The resulting EARSM has been found to be well suited to integration to the wall and all individual Reynolds stresses can be well predicted by introducing wall damping functions derived from the van Driest damping function. The platform for the model consists of the transport equations for the kinetic energy and an auxiliary quantity. The proposed model can be used with any such platform, and examples are shown for two different choices of the auxiliary quantity.},
