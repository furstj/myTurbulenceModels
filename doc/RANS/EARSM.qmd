title: "EARSM model"
---
The `EARSM` (Explicit Algebraic Reynolds Stress Model) is a RANS turbulence model developed by Hellsten [@Hellsten2005]. It is based on the Boussinesq approximation but goes beyond the linear eddy-viscosity concept by providing an explicit algebraic formulation for the Reynolds stress tensor. This allows the model to capture anisotropic turbulence effects more accurately than traditional two-equation models.
